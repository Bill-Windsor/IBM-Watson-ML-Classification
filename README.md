# IBM Data Science Professional Certification: Machine Learning / Classification

Machine Learning Classification and Accuracy Score Measurements, evaluating a dataset for creditworthiness and credit loan performance mapped to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the bank's clients. The project performs classification and assessment utilizing these machine learning algorithms:  
 * K-Nearest Neighbors  
 * Decision Tree  
 * Support Vector Machine  
 * Logistic Regression  

assessed using these Accuracy Score Measurements:  
 * Jaccard Similarity Score  
 * F1-Score  
 * LogLoss - for Logistic Regression  

The analyses may be rendered and viewed with the Jupyter Notebook Viewer web facility by clicking on this URL:
