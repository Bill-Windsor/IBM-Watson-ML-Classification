# IBM Data Science Professional Certification: Machine Learning / Classification

Machine Learning Classification and Accuracy Score Measurements, evaluating a dataset for creditworthiness and credit loan performance mapped to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the bank's clients. The project performs classification and assessment utilizing these machine learning algorithms:  
 * K-Nearest Neighbors  
 * Decision Tree  
 * Support Vector Machine  
 * Logistic Regression  

assessed using these Accuracy Score Measurements:
 * Jaccard Similarity Score
 * F1-Score
 * LogLoss - for Logistic Regression
